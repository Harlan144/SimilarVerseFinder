    <h2>About Similar Verse Finder</h2>
    <p >This website was created by the <a href="https://biology.byu.edu/piccolo-lab" class="about_link">Piccolo Lab</a>.
        Our goal is to facilitate dialogue between religions and help members of The Church of Jesus
        Christ of Latter-Day Saints and other religions to compare scriptures and find novel similarities for personal
        religious study.
        To use this tool, users may select a verse from the Standard Works (Old Testament, New Testament, Book of
        Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, or the Pearl of Great Price), and the five most semantically similar verses (as
        ranked by our machine learning model) will be returned.
        Alternatively, users may input a prompt/sentence of their choice and the five most similar verses will be
        returned.
        This web-based tool relies a machine-learning-based approach to find semantic similarities between scriptural
        texts using cosine similarities generated with a <a
            href="https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers" class="about_link">SentenceTransformers</a>
        model. More information about the development of this project can be found at <a
            href="https://github.com/brownthesr/Exegesis-of-Ancient-Texts" class="about_link"> our GitHub</a>. We plan to publish this work
        in a peer-reviewed journal and use this model to analyze semantic predictions across different scriptural texts to find novel
        religious insights.
